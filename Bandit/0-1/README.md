First i read the task at hand, 

```
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
```

Then i proceeded to login in, then i tried ls, which told me readme file was in the same directory as i was currently in then i just wrote cat readme and got the password for the next level.

bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
