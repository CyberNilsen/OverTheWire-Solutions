Reading the goal again, i find its kind of the same as the last level, therefore we have to run the same command again. But instead of writing the full thing myself i just tab when searching for the file, aka cat -- then press tab to let the terminal fill it out for you yourself, this also shows you have to write it manually if you want to do this instead.

```
The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory
```

bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
--spaces in this filename--
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--
