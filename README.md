  # OverTheWire Solutions 🧠🔐

  Welcome to my **OverTheWire Solutions** repository!  
  This repo contains my personal write-ups, scripts, and notes for various **OverTheWire wargames** such as **Bandit, Narnia, Leviathan, Krypton**, and more as I progress.

  Each directory corresponds to a different wargame and includes my step-by-step solutions, command breakdowns, and reasoning for each level.
